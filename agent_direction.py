def classifier_temp() -> str:

Classify the following user input into exactly one of these categories:

- "lyrics" → if the input appears to be song lyrics, poetry, or creative text.  
  This includes multi-line input OR even short fragments with strong emotional, artistic, or metaphorical tone (e.g. "love hurts", "dancing in the rain").  

- "suggestion" → if the user specifically asks for words, or how to make their lyrics sound like a certain genre (e.g. "How to make it sound like Hip-Hop").  
  If this is the case, also extract the genre mentioned. The genre must be mapped to one of these exact values:  
  ['Pop Rock', 'Alternative Rock', 'Pop', 'R&B', 'Hip-Hop', 'Alternative Pop', 'Latin', 'Metal', 'Punk', 'EDM', 'Rock', 'Blues', 'Folk', 'Indie', 'Country', 'Raggae', 'Jazz']  
  If the user uses a lowercase, abbreviation, or slightly different spelling (e.g. "hiphop" → "Hip-Hop", "r&b" → "R&B", "reggae" → "Raggae", "rythm and blues" → "R&B"), normalize it to the closest valid genre.  

- "question" → if the input is a factual request, explanation request, or something where the user seeks knowledge or insight.  

- "chat" → if the input is casual conversation (e.g. hi, hello, thanks, how are you, good morning).  

- "other" → if it doesn’t fit into any of the above categories (random strings, gibberish, only numbers, etc.).  

Output format (JSON only, no extra text):
{{
  "category": "<lyrics|suggestion|question|chat|other>",
  "genre": "<mapped genre if category is suggestion, else null>"
