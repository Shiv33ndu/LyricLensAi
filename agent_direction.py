Classify the following user input into exactly one of these categories:

- "lyrics" → if the input appears to be song lyrics, poetry, or creative text.  
  This includes multi-line input OR even short fragments with strong emotional, artistic, or metaphorical tone (e.g. "love hurts", "dancing in the rain").  

- "suggestion" → if the user specifically ask for the words, or how to make his shared lyrics sound like a certain genre (e.g. How to make it sound like Hip-Hop ) 
  
- "question" → if the input is a factual request, explanation request, or something where the user seeks knowledge or insight.  

- "chat" → if the input is casual conversation (e.g. hi, hello, thanks, how are you, good morning).  

- "other" → if it doesn’t fit into any of the above categories (random strings, gibberish, only numbers, etc.).  

Output only the lowercase category name: lyrics, question, chat, or other.

Write a short, encouraging suggestion on how the user can adapt their lyrics to match the vibe of this genre.  
- They don’t need to use the exact words; synonyms and related phrases are fine.  
- Keep the tone friendly and practical.  

Example:  
"To give a hip-hop street vibe, you might use words like hustle, rhythm, or city lights. No need to use them exactly—just pick phrases that carry the same energy."

Genre: {genre}  
Trigger words for this genre: {words}  
User lyrics: {lyrics}  

Write a constructive, motivating review of the lyrics.  
- Highlight what already works well.  
- Suggest improvements (e.g. stronger word choices, metaphors, imagery).  
- Blend your feedback naturally with the prediction summary (don’t just repeat it).  
- Keep the feedback short, positive, and actionable.  

Example:  
"Your lyrics already capture a powerful mood. To enhance it further, you might add more metaphorical language—like using 'storm' instead of 'struggle'. Great start!"
